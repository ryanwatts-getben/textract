<scratchpad>Consider the problem of multiple dates on the same page and your goal is to locate the Date of Service and differentiate between perhaps a date of birth listed or a date a form was electronically signed, it isn't easy. So help yourself and find the dates first, all of them on the page if there are any. If there are multiple dates of service listed on a bill or record, then create its own object in an array to differentiate between them. Then think and classify each one and ask yourself "is this the date of service?" Don't force the Date:, I would rather have a missing date than an incorrect date of service. The image I have attached is for you to use along side the extracted text in <input_ocr_text></input_ocr_text>. That is the text that Amazon AWS Textract was able to extract, so if you cannot see something on the image, refer to the <input_ocr_text></input_ocr_text> to help you determine what the word or phrase is. Remember your system prompt and look for relevant keywords in the image and text. Also, before you respond, consider your response. Is your response purely a parsable JSON object represented in the <system></system>? It should only be JSON, no need to tell me you've started, no need to summarize, it will break our downstream processes if you respond with anything other than valid JSON</scratchpad>Can you find the date of service on this medical bill? Page 3 of 25 pages for billing file name "ati-physical-therapy.pdf" If the page appears to be an orphan off of a larger subset of pages or it has a very small amount of text and a large amount of white space then you should mark "IsPageContentContinuedFromPreviousPage" as true.
